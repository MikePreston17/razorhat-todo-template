# Troubleshooting üêõ

1. Railway's Docker build fails to on `dotnet restore`
   A: Make sure you have the `NIXPACKS_CSHARP_SDK_VERSION` set in your Railway Environment variables (see the editor under '`Settings`').  For this build, I'm using: `NIXPACKS_CSHARP_SDK_VERSION=7.0`
2. Railway mysteriously says your deployment cannot be found...
   A: Make sure your `PORT` enviroment variable is set.  Railway does not (at this time) warn you about this...  e.g.: `PORT=3000`.
