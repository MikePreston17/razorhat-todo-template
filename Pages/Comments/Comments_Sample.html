We rejoice with you!\n\nWe too have and are being helped, instructed, corrected and encouraged in the last 4 years, FAR beyond anything we had ever received in our previous 40 plus years of life. At no point in my life until coming to The Path of Truth has anyone ever taught me to trust The Lord like Victor has and still is!\n\nBless The Lord! I\u2019m so happy for all of you!",

Flee all forms of religion, which exercises itself in every area of life - churchdom, government, medicine, entertainment, fashion, commerce, agriculture, food-production, processing, adulteration, and distribution.\n\nHebrews 4:12 - divide the good from the evil. Heed the Word of God. When we allow any pollution and corruption, we invite suffering, loss, and death. When we receive the Truth, we invite victory, security, healing, prosperity, peace, life, and joy. That's how it is. \n\nWhich do we choose and stand with - the prince of this world or the Prince of peace? The destroyer with all his machinations or the Savior in all His Glory? The one who seeks to deceive, steal, kill, and destroy us in all his devious, fleshly, and worldly ways, or the One Who laid His Life down for us so that we might, from the beginning to the end, have His Favor with Everlasting Life, Wisdom, and Power?\n\nIt doesn't take two brains to know the answer. In fact, we don't want two brains - it's called \"double-mindedness.\" One brain will do and only One, the Mind of Christ, our Creator and Lover. Amen?",
